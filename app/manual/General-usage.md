# General usage

**INFO: The keyboard shortcuts mentioned in this document refer to the default shortcuts of the EMU-webApp. As it is 
possible to overwrite these, please contact the person hosting your database for information about deviations from this
default behaviour.**

The EMU-webApp has slightly different labeling mechanics to other annotation software. Compared to the usual
click & drag of segment boundaries the web application continuously tracks the movement of the mouse, highlighting the 
boundary that is closest to it by coloring it blue:

The user can now perform various actions with this preselected boundary. He/she can for example grab the boundary by 
holding down the shift key and moving it to the desired position:

Or delete the current boundary by hitting the backspace key:
